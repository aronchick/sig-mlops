# Introduction

## Current State of MLOps

> NOTES: Overview of the current state of MLOps for this year - revised annually. Define principles and methodologies.

### What is MLOps?

MLOps could be narrowly defined as "the ability to apply DevOps principles to Machine Learning applications" however as we shall see shortly, this narrow definition misses the true value of MLOps to the customer. Instead, we define MLOps as “the extension of the DevOps methodology to include Machine Learning and Data Science assets as first class citizens within the DevOps ecology”.

MLOps should be viewed as a practice for consistently managing the ML aspects of products in a way that is unified with all of the other technical and non-technical elements necessary to successfully commercialise those products with maximum potential for viability in the marketplace. This includes DataOps, too, as machine learning without complete, consistent, semantically valid, correct, timely, and unbiased data is problematic or leads to flawed solutions that can exacerbate built-in biases.


> MLOps is not to be confused with "AIOps". AIOps often means an application of AI technologies to Ops data with sometimes unclear aims for gaining insights. These terms are still evolving, but for the purposes of this document we do not mean AIOps in the latter usage. Some organisations are more comfortable with the designation 'AI' rather than 'Machine Learning' and so it is to be expected that MLOps may be referred to by AIOps in those domains, however the reverse is not true as use of the term 'AIOps' may not refer to the MLOps methodology.


### What is MLOps not?

It sometimes helps to consider what anti-patterns exist around a concept in order to better understand it.

For example, MLOps is not "putting Jupyter Notebooks into production environments".

RAD tools like Jupyter Notebooks can be extremely useful, both in classroom environments and in exploring problem spaces to understand potential approaches to mathematical problems. However, like all Rapid Application Development tools, they achieve the rapid element of their name by trading off other key non-functional requirements like maintainability, testability and scalability.

In the next section, we will discuss the key drivers for MLOps and expand upon the requirements for a true DevOps approach to managing ML assets. At this point in the development of the practice, it perhaps helps to understand that much of ML and AI research and development activity has been driven by Data Science rather than Computer Science teams. This specialisation has enabled great leaps in the ML field but at the same time means that a significant proportion of ML practitioners have never been exposed to the lessons of the past seventy years of managing software assets in commercial environments.

As we shall see, this can result in large conceptual gaps between what is involved in creating a viable proof of concept of a trained ML model on a Data Scientist’s laptop vs what it subsequently takes to be able to safely transition that asset into a commercial product in production environments. It is not therefore unfair to describe the current state of MLOps in 2020 as still on the early path towards maturity and to consider that much of the early challenge for adoption will be one of education and communication rather than purely technical refinements to tooling.

Compounding this challenge, Machine Learning solutions tend to be decision-making systems rather than just data processing systems and thus will be required to be held accountable to much higher standards than those applied to the best quality software delivery projects. The bar for quality and governance processes is therefore very high, in many cases representing legal compliance processes mandated by regional legislation.

As these decision-making solutions increasingly displace human decision-makers in commerce and government, we encounter a new class of governance problems, collectively known as ‘Responsible AI’. These introduce a range of challenges around complex issues such as ethics, fairness and bias in ML models and often fall under government regulation requiring interpretability and explainability of models, often to a standard higher than that applied to human staff.

As a result, it will be necessary for MLOps to develop in a manner that facilitates complex and sensitive governance processes that are of a standard appropriate to what is expected to become a highly regulated area.

## Vision

> NOTES: Narrative vision for the future of MLOps.

An optimal MLOps experience is one where Machine Learning assets are treated consistently with all other software assets within a CI/CD environment. Machine Learning models can be deployed alongside the services that wrap them and the services that consume them as part of a unified release process.

MLOps must be language-agnostic. Training scripts for ML models can be written in a wide range of different programming languages, so a focus on Python is artificially limiting to widespread adoption.

MLOps must be framework-agnostic. There are a plethora of different Machine Learning frameworks commonly in use today and it is to be expected that these will continue to proliferate over time. It must be possible to use any desired framework within an MLOps context and be possible to combine multiple frameworks in any given deployment.

MLOps must be platform and infrastructure agnostic. Adoption of MLOps is predicated upon being able to operate using this approach within the constraints of previously defined corporate infrastructure. It should be presumed unlikely that MLOps alone is a sufficient driver to motivate fundamental change to infrastructure.

It is very important that MLOps should make no over-simplified assumptions with respect to hardware. To achieve currently known customer requirements in a range of ML fields, it will be necessary to achieve performance gains of at least three orders of magnitude. This can be expected to lead to significant change with respect to the hardware utilised to train and execute models.

We make the following assertions:

- Models may expect to be **trained** on various combinations CPU, GPU, TPU, dedicated ASICs or custom neuro-morphic silicon, with new hardware entering the market regularly.
- Models may expect to be **executed** on various combinations CPU, GPU, TPU, dedicated ASICs or custom neuro-morphic silicon, again with new hardware entering the market regularly.
- It **must not** be assumed that models will be executed on the same hardware as they are trained upon.

It is desirable to have the ability to train once but run anywhere, that is, models are trained on specific hardware to minimise training time, and optimised for different target devices based on cost or performance considerations, however this aspiration may need to be tempered with a degree of pragmatism. The ability to train on a given hardware platform requires, at minimum, dedicated driver support, and in practice usually also necessitates extensive library / framework support. The ability to execute on a given hardware platform may involve having to significantly optimise resource usage to lower product cost or require the production of dedicated silicon specific to a single task.

 Whilst there will undoubtedly be common scenarios, for example in Cloud deployment, where CPU -> CPU or GPU -> GPU is sufficient to meet requirements, MLOps must allow for a broad range of potential cross-compilation scenarios. 

MLOps implementations should follow a ‘convention over configuration’ pattern, seeking to minimise the level of build-specific assets that need to be maintained on top of the desired solution. Where configuration is necessary, it should be synthesised where possible and operate on the principle of always creating working examples that can be modified incrementally by customers to meet their needs.

The use of MLOps should teach best known methods of applying MLOps. It should be recognised that many customers will be experts in the field of Data Science but may have had relatively little exposure to DevOps or other SDLC principles. To minimise the learning curve, MLOps defaults should always align to best practice in production environments rather than ‘quick-and-dirty’ as might be the case for expert users wishing to trial an instance of the tooling in a test bench environment.



# Scope

The focus of this roadmap is upon aspects relating to extending DevOps principles to the area of Machine Learning and does not discuss basic features of DevOps or CI/CD approaches that are common across both domains. The intention is for MLOps to decorate DevOps rather than differentiate.

# Technology Requirements

> NOTES: Identify specific technology requirements to enable progress against the challenges identified above.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Educating data science teams regarding the risks of trying to use Jupyter Notebooks in production</td>
    <td>Jupyter Notebooks are the tool we use to educate Data Scientists as they can easily be used to explore ad hoc ML problems incrementally on a laptop. Unfortunately, when all you have is a hammer, everything tends to look like a nail. </br></br>We see Jupyter Notebooks featuring in production scenarios, not because this are the best tool for the job, but because this is the tool we taught people to use and because we didn't teach about any of the problems inherent in using that tool. </br></br>This approach persists because of an ongoing gap in the tool chain.</br></br>
- Improved technology solutions are required that enable Data Scientists to easily run experiments at scale on elastic Cloud resources in a consistent, audited and repeatable way.</br>
- These solutions should integrate with existing Integrated Development Environments, Source Code Control and Quality Management tools.</br>
- Solutions should integrate with CI/CD environments so as to facilitate Data Scientists setting up multiple variations on a training approach and launching these as parallel, audited activities on Cloud infrastructure.</br>
- Working with the training of models and the consumption of trained models should be a seamless experience within a single toolchain.</br>
- Tooling should introduce new Data Scientists to the core concepts of software asset management, quality management and automated testing.</br>
- Tooling should enable appropriate governance processes around the release of ML assets into team environments.</br></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Treat ML assets as first class citizens in DevOps processes</td>
    <td>ML assets include but are not training sets, training configurations (hyperparameters), scripts and models. Some of these assets can be large, some are more like source code assets. We should be able to track changes to all these assets, and see how the changes relate to each other. Reporting on popular devops "metrics" like "Change Failure Rate" and "Mean cycle time" should be possible if done correctly. Whilst some of these assets are large, they are not without precedent in the devops world. People have been handling changes to database configurations, copying and backup of data for some time, so they same should apply to all ML assets. In the following sections we can explore how this may be implemented.</td>

    It should be possible to use MLOps tooling to deploy solution components utilising different languages or frameworks using loosely-coupled principles to provide compatibility layers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Approaches for enabling MLOps to support a broad range of target platforms, including but not limited to CPU, GPU, TPU, custom ASICs and neuromorphic silicon.</td>
    <td>MLOps should be considered as a cross-compilation problem where the architectures of the source and target platforms may be different. In trivial cases, models may be trained on say CPU or GPU and deployed to execute on the same CPU or GPU architecture, however other scenarios already exist and should be expected to be increasingly likely in the future. This may include training on GPU / TPU and executing on CPU or, in edge devices, training on any architecture and then translating the models into physical logic that can be implemented at very low cost / size / power directly on FPGA or ASIC devices.</br></br>
    This implies the need for architecture-independent intermediate formats to facilitate cross-deployment or cross-compilation onto target platforms.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Methods for ensuring efficient use of hardware in both training and operational scenarios</td>
    <td>ML training and inferencing operations are typically very processing intensive operations that can expect to be accelerated by the use of dedicated hardware. Training is essentially an intermittent ad-hoc process that may run for hours-to-days to complete a single training run, demanding full utilisation of large scale compute resources for this period and then releasing that demand outside active training runs. Similarly, inferencing on a model may be processing intensive during a given execution. Elastic scaling of hardware resources will be essential for minimising cost of ownership however the dedicated nature of existing accelerator cards makes it currently hard to scale these elastically in today's Cloud infrastructure.</br></br>
    Additionally, some accelerators provide the ability to subdivide processing resource into smaller allocation units to allow for efficient allocation of smaller work units within high capacity infrastructure.</br></br>
    It will be necessary to extend the capabilities of existing Cloud platforms to permit more efficient utilisation of expensive compute resources whilst managing overall demand across multiple customers in a way that mitigates security and privacy concerns.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Approaches for applying MLOps to very large scale problems at petabyte scale and beyond</td>
    <td>As of 2020, large ML data sets are considered to start at around 50TB and very large data sets may derive from petabytes of source data, especially in visual applications such as autonomous vehicle control. At these scales, it becomes necessary to spread ML workloads across thousands of GPU instances in order to keep overall training times within acceptable elapsed time windows (less than a week per run).</br></br>
    Individual GPUs are currently able to process in the order of 1-10GB of data per second but only have around 40GB of local RAM. An individual server can be expected to have around 1TB of conventional RAM and around 15TB of local high speed storage as cache for around 8 GPUs, so may be able to transfer data between these and the compute units at high hundreds of GB/s with upstream connections to network storage running at low hundreds of GB/s.</br></br>
    Efficient workflows rely upon being able to reduce problems into smaller sub-units with constrained data requirements or systems start to become I/O bound. MLOps tooling for large problems must be able to efficiently decompose training and inferencing workloads into individual operations and data sets that can be effectively distributed as parallel activities across a homogeneous infrastructure with a supercomputing-style architecture. This can be expected to exceed the capabilities of conventional Cloud computing infrastructure and require dedicated hardware components and architecture so any MLOps tooling must have appropriate awareness of the target architecture in order to optimise deployments.</br></br>
    At this scale, it is not feasible to create multiple physical copies of petabytes of training data due to storage capacity constraints and limitations of data transfer rates, so strategies for versioning sets of data with metadata against an incrementally growing pool will be necessary.</td>
